# TRAINS-and-TOWNS-task
I wrote this algorithm in pure event driven architecture without Promise and Async/Await. Algorithm inputs: graph, 
route [ , max distance, max stops ] and calculates 
- distance through route 
- different routes count which is less than max distance and through route stops is no more than max stops

## Getting Started
### Running in terminal
```shell
cd appFolder
node TT.js [graph] [route] [maxLength maxStops]
```

maxLength and maxStops is optional inputs, by default maxLength = 30, maxStops = 7
